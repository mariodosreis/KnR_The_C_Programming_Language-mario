Mary had a little lamb
it's fleece was white as snow
and everywhere that Mary went
the lamb was sure to go

He followed her to school one day
which was against the rule
it made the children laugh and play
to see a lamb at school

And so the teacher turned him out
but still he lingered near
and waited patiently about
till Mary did appear

What makes the lamb love Mary so?
the eager children cry
why, Mary loves the lamb, you know
the teacher did reply
